# Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) Skill

> **Disclaimer:** This skill provides educational and advisory guidance based on W3C WCAG documentation. It does not constitute legal advice. Conformance claims, accessibility statements, and legal compliance determinations must involve qualified accessibility specialists and legal counsel. WCAG is developed by the W3C Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) and is subject to ongoing revision — always verify against the current normative specification at w3.org/WAI/WCAG.

## 1. What Does the Skill Do?

This skill turns Claude into an expert advisor on the **Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)** — the W3C international standard for digital accessibility developed by the Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI). It provides structured, criterion-level guidance to developers, designers, product owners, QA engineers, and compliance teams implementing WCAG across web, mobile, and digital content.

The skill covers three normative W3C Recommendations: **WCAG 2.0** (2008), **WCAG 2.1** (2018), and **WCAG 2.2** (October 2023). It is grounded in all four POUR principles — Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, Robust — and understands the full success criteria set: 38 criteria in WCAG 2.0, 17 additional criteria added in WCAG 2.1, and 9 further criteria added in WCAG 2.2 (plus the removal of SC 4.1.1 Parsing). It also provides a preview of the WCAG 3.0 working draft and its new Bronze/Silver/Gold scoring model.

Beyond criterion explanation, the skill provides implementation-ready output: accessibility audit issue tables with severity and element references, conformance reviews, ARIA patterns matched to WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices Guide keyboard conventions, contrast ratio calculations, code-annotated reviews with violations and corrected examples, and accessibility statements conforming to the EU Web Accessibility Directive model. It also maps WCAG to the global legal landscape — EN 301 549 (EU EAA), Section 508, UK PSBAR 2018, AODA, and ADA Title III case law — enabling compliance teams to understand which WCAG version and level is legally required in each jurisdiction.

## 3. Common Use Cases

### Accessibility Audits and Gap Assessments

- Run a WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility audit gap assessment for our e-commerce checkout flow
- Produce an audit issue table with criterion number, issue description, element reference, severity, and remediation steps
- We have these findings from our automated axe scan — classify them by WCAG criterion and prioritise remediation
- What WCAG 2.2 AA criteria might we fail that we were not checking against WCAG 2.1?
- Identify the highest-severity WCAG 2.1 AA failures that would block screen reader users

### Criterion Explanations and Implementation Guidance

- Explain SC 1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum) — what exactly does 4.5:1 mean and how do I calculate it?
- What does SC 2.4.11 Focus Not Obscured require and how do I fix sticky headers that cover focused elements?
- Walk me through implementing SC 3.3.8 Accessible Authentication — what counts as an accessible alternative to CAPTCHA?
- What ARIA roles and properties does SC 4.1.2 require for a custom tab panel widget?
- Explain the difference between SC 2.5.7 Dragging Movements and SC 2.5.8 Target Size — both new in WCAG 2.2

### Code Review and ARIA Implementation

- Review this React modal component for WCAG 2.1 AA violations
- Show me the correct ARIA pattern for an accordion that expands and collapses
- My autocomplete combobox is not announced correctly by NVDA — what ARIA attributes am I missing?
- Annotate this HTML form with all the WCAG failures and provide the corrected version
- What ARIA live region pattern should I use to announce "Item added to cart" to screen reader users?

### Conformance and Accessibility Statements

- Draft a WCAG 2.1 Level AA accessibility statement for our UK public sector website
- What must an accessibility statement include to comply with the EU Web Accessibility Directive?
- We claim WCAG 2.1 AA conformance but fail SC 1.2.4 Captions (Live) — how do we document this exception?
- What is the difference between WCAG 2.0 AA, 2.1 AA, and 2.2 AA conformance claims?
- Can a site that fails one AA criterion still claim partial conformance?

### Legal and Regulatory Mapping

- What WCAG version and level is required under the European Accessibility Act (EAA) for private sector companies?
- Map WCAG requirements to the laws that apply in EU, US, UK, Canada, and Australia
- Our product is used in the EU — does the June 2025 EAA deadline apply to us?
- How does EN 301 549 relate to WCAG 2.1, and what chapters cover web content?
- A client says their ADA settlement requires WCAG 2.1 AA — what does that mean practically?

### Testing Methodology

- What is the recommended testing methodology for a WCAG 2.1 AA audit?
- Which automated tools catch the most WCAG failures and what are their limitations?
- What screen reader and browser combinations should I use for comprehensive testing?
- How do I test SC 1.4.10 Reflow at 320 CSS pixels?
- What does the Text Spacing bookmarklet test and how do I use it for SC 1.4.12?

### WCAG 2.2 New Criteria

- What are all the new success criteria in WCAG 2.2 and which are Level AA?
- We currently meet WCAG 2.1 AA — what additional work is needed to reach WCAG 2.2 AA?
- Explain the three new focus-related criteria in WCAG 2.2 (SC 2.4.11, 2.4.12, 2.4.13)
- Is SC 4.1.1 Parsing still required under WCAG 2.2?
- How does SC 3.3.7 Redundant Entry affect multi-step forms and checkout flows?

## 4. How to Use the Skill

### Installation

1. Download the `wcag.skill` file from the `WCAG - Claude Skill/` folder
2. In Claude, go to **Settings → Skills**
3. Upload the `.skill` file
4. The skill activates automatically for relevant conversations — no special command needed

### Triggering the Skill

The skill triggers automatically for any digital accessibility question, even without explicitly mentioning "WCAG" or "skill." Example phrases that activate it:

- _"Why is my site failing accessibility checks?"_
- _"What contrast ratio does this text need?"_
- _"My screen reader isn't reading the modal correctly"_
- _"We need to comply with EN 301 549 for the EU market"_
- _"Write an accessibility statement for our website"_
- _"What changed in WCAG 2.2?"_
- _"How do I make this dropdown keyboard accessible?"_
- _"We got an ADA demand letter about our website's accessibility"_

### Example Prompts

```
"Run a WCAG 2.2 AA gap assessment for a SaaS web application. Known
issues include: no skip link, some icon buttons without accessible names,
drag-only sortable lists, a CAPTCHA with no alternative on the login page,
and colour-only required field indicators on forms."
```

```
"Review this React component for WCAG 2.1 AA violations and provide
the corrected version with inline comments explaining each fix:

<div onClick={handleClick} class='btn'>Submit</div>
<div class='error' style='color:red'>Please fix errors above</div>
<img src='logo.png'>
<div role='checkbox'>Accept terms</div>"
```

```
"Draft a WCAG 2.1 Level AA accessibility statement for a UK public
sector organisation. Include: conformance claim, scope, known
non-conformances (SC 1.2.4 live captions not provided, SC 2.4.5
no site search), alternatives available, date of last assessment,
and complaints procedure as required by PSBAR 2018."
```

```
"Map WCAG 2.1 AA to the accessibility laws that apply to us. We sell
software to: federal agencies in the US, enterprises in the EU,
public sector bodies in the UK, and large organisations in Ontario,
Canada. For each jurisdiction, tell us the required WCAG version,
level, applicable law, and compliance deadline."
```

```
"Our development team needs a practical WCAG 2.2 AA testing checklist.
For each criterion, include: what to test, which automated tool covers
it, which AT + browser combination to use for manual testing, and the
most common failure pattern."
```
